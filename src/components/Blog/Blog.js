            What is Difference between authorization and authentication?
          </Accordion.Header>
          <Accordion.Body>
            authentication is the process of verifying who someone is, whereas
            authorization is the process of verifying what specific
            applications, files, and data a user has access to. The situation is
            like that of an airline that needs to determine which people can
            come on board.

              Google is big secure company, it's services will be secure and
              powerful than other company. With Firebase, it's pretty simple to
              connect and use built-in third-party authentication providers,
              including Google, Facebook, Twitter, among others. And if we want
              to use a pre-built authentication UI, we have it at your disposal
              as well. All of these can save we a significant amount of
              development cost, as we don't need to pay as high as developing
              from scratch.
